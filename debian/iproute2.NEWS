iproute2 (6.5.0-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  iproute2's upstream now installs default configuration files under /usr/
  instead of /etc/, following the hermetic-usr pattern. Files with the same
  names in /etc/ will override the defaults in /usr/. Any locally modified old
  configuration file in /etc/ will be retained as an override on upgrade.
